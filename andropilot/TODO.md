# android:
* remove application.conf from resource fork
* add flight mode control / display
* add log file capture 
* detect device disconnection
* run service in background
* create wiki/site
* FIXME - sometimes we find two extra bytes - I bet those are the headers for a packet (seems ignorable for now)
* restore map after classloader fixed
